A proxy service is a service that acts as an intermediary between clients performing requests and services that serve those requests.

- 3 types of proxy services:
   - "Gateway" or "tunneling service": redirect requests to the destination services and responses back to the clients that made those requests
   - "Forward proxy": used to retrieve data from different sources (mostly internet)
   - "Reverse proxy": control and protect access to a server or services on a private network. Besides its primary function, a reverse proxy often also performs tasks such as load-balancing, decryption, caching and authentication
